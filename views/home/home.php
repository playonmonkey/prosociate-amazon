<h3 style='margin-top: -20px;'>Three reasons to upgrade to the professional edition of Prosociate</h3>

<p><b>1. Make more money with On-Site Cart</b></p>

<p>
 In the professional edition of Prosociate, visitors add products to their cart on your website. This way you can get commission for multiple products. When your visitors are ready to check out, they get sent to Amazon automatically.
</p>

<p>
	Usually there is a 24 hour window to receive credit for a sale after following a standard Amazon affiliate link, which is the type of link posted by the free version of Prosociate.
</p>

<p>
	But in the professional edition of Prosociate, integration with the WooCommerce shopping cart is provided. When  Prosociate adds the product(s) to the cart, Amazon extends the window of time to earn a commission to 90 days â€“ ensuring your earning potential is maximized.
